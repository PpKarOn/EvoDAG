# RGP

Root Genetic Programming (RGP) is a steady-state Genetic Programming system
with tournament selection. The main characteristic of RGP is that
the genetic operation is performed at the root. RGP was inspired
by the geometric semantic crossover proposed by 
[Alberto Moraglio](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=0y4XRI0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)
_et al._ and the implementation performed by
[Leonardo Vanneschi](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=uR5K07QAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)
_et al_.
